RLS     -> standard RLS: uniform random neighbour with Hamming Distance == 1
RLS-N   -> modified RLS: uniform random neighbour with Hamming Distance <= n
RLS-R   -> modified RLS: uniform random neighbour with Hamming Distance == x, where x is chosen uniform random from {1,...,r}
EA      -> standard EA : each bit is flipped with prob 1/n
EA-SM   -> modified EA : each bit is flipped with prob c/n
fmut    -> 1 bit flip with prob p and uniform random amount with 1-p
pmut    -> flips k random bits where k is chosen from powerlaw distribution
