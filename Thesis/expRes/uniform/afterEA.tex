The (1+1) EA seems to perform better with a lower mutation rate.
The vales $p_m=2/n$ and $p_m=3/n$ reach an optimal solution equally fast.
From then on speed of convergence decreases with increasing mutation rate.
The only exception from this case is the (1+1) EA which performs the worst despite having the lowest mutation rate.
For the uniform distributed input all variants of the (1+1) EA reach an optimal solution within the step limit as for the previous input types.
