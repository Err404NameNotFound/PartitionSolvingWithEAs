The static mutation rate $3/n$ seems to perform the best with both $4/n$ and $2/n$ being a close second place. The next best values are $5/n$ and the standard $1/n$ both having a clear difference between each other and the better parameters. From then on the number of iterations rises monotonically with rising mutation rate. The higher mutation rates perform significantly worse but the still find a solution within the limit as opposed to the standard RLS.
