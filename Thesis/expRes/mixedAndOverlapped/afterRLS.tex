As expected the results are similar to the mixed input.
There is a clear preference of algorithms with higher probability to flip only one bit per step.
Mixed and geometric distributions did not lead to very bad performance for the $RLS-N_4$.
The mixed and overlapped input punishes the worse mutation operators more than the other two inputs.
In that sense this type of input is closer to the OneMax equivalent, but still way less extreme.
Here still every variant reaches an optimal solution in every case.
