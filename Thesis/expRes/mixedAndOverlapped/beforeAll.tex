This distribution is again similar to the mixed distribution.
With probability 1/2 the value is chosen from the overlapped distribution and with remaining probability 1/2 the value is chosen from the mixed distribution.

The used distributions were \textasciitilde$U(1,49999)$, \textasciitilde$B(10000,0.1)$, \textasciitilde$Geo(0.001)$, powerlaw distribution with $\beta=-1.25$.
By looking at Figure~\ref{fig:mixAndOverlDistExample} it looks like the mixed and overlapped distribution is closer to the mixed distribution than to the overlapped distribution.
The results should also be closer to the mixed distribution.
