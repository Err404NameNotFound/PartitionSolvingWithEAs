The results for the (1+1) EA are similar but not the same.
Algorithms that had a good runtime on binomial inputs also have a good runtime in the overlapped runs, but the ranking is not the same.
For this input every the first and second place switched, the same for 3rd and 4th and also for 5th and 6th place.
This may be only caused by chance and the performance within a pair being really close but might also be caused by something else.
The (1+1) EA variants also needed about 500 times as long as for the binomial inputs.
