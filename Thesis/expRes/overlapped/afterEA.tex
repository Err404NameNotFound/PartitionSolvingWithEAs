The results for the (1+1) EA are similar but not the same.
Algorithms that had a good runtime on binomial inputs also have a good runtime in the overlapped runs, but the ranking is not the same.
For this input every the first and second place switched, the same for 3rd and 4th and also for 5th and 6th place.
This may be only caused by chance and the performance within a pair being really close but might also be caused by something else.
The (1+1) EA variants also needed about 200 times as long as for the binomial inputs.
All runs had at least 2 runs where they did not find an optimal solution.
These runs all had a remaining difference of one to the optimal value.
More time would probably be enough to reach an optimal solution in most cases.
