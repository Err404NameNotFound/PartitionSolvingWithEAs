The results for this distribution are somewhat similar to the results of the binomial distribution.
The best and worst algorithms are the same.
Only the RLS almost fails to find an optimal solution for almost every input.
For the binomial distribution the $RLS-N_3$ also failed around 25\% or the inputs but here it does not.
It is even the second-best variant instead of being the second-worst.
Apart from that the ranking in between is also different.
The RLS-N variants perform the best followed by the RLS-R variants and lastly the RLS.
For the RLS-N the performance decreases with increasing $k$ but for the RLS-R this relation is inverted.
Another big difference is the number of steps needed to find a global optimum.
For the binomial input all algorithms except the RLS were really fast and only needed below 1000 iterations on average.
All algorithms need around 250 times the number of steps on average for the overlapped input.
This caused some of them to not be fast enough to solve the input always in time $10n\ln(n)$.
