The results for this distribution are rather similar to the results of the binomial distribution.
The ranking of the algorithms is completely the same.
Only the RLS almost fails to find an optimal solution for almost every input.
For the binomial distribution the $RLS-N_3$ also failed around 25\% or the inputs but here it does not.
Another big difference is the number of steps needed to find a global optimum.
For the binomial input all algorithms except the RLS were really fast and only needed below 1000 iterations on average.
All algorithm need around 500 times the number of steps on average as compared to the binomial inputs.
