This input is similar to the mixed input from the last subsection.
For this distribution the values are not chosen uniform random from one of the base distributions but instead a value from every distribution is chosen and added together.
Hence the name overlapped distribution.
For this input the step limit was increased to $100\cdot n \ln n$.
The comparison for the step limit $10\cdot n \ln n$ is contained in only for the best algorithms.
