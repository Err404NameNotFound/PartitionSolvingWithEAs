The results here are the same as for the binomial input. The $RLS-N_2$ performs better than the (1+1) EA and $pmut_\beta$ mutation for all values of $c/n$ and $\beta$ by a factor of 1.5 with a step limit of $10 \cdot n \ln(n)$. For the lower values of $n$ this does not hold to that extreme.

\input{tables/overlapped/multipleN_fails.tex}

Here almost no algorithm manages to find an optimal solution in most cases as all algorithms fail for more than 70 \% of the inputs.
The RLS variants perform the worst again for the small input sizes.
Only for $n\ge500$ the $RLS-N_{2}$ is a good option due to the huge performance increase between $n=100$ and $n=500$.
Overlapped inputs stay hard to solve relatively long as only for $n\ge50,000$ all best variants of each algorithm find an optimal solution for every input.

\input{tables/overlapped/multipleN_avg.tex}

For $n\le1000$ the performance seems almost constant, but this is caused by the constant step limit of 100,000.
After $n=1000$ the value of $10 \cdot n \ln(n)$ was bigger than 100,000.

\input{tables/overlapped/multipleN_totalAvg.tex}

No algorithm is very successful for the small values of $n$.
Choosing the (1+1) EA for $n<500$ should result in the best runtime in most of the cases.
Only the $RLS-N_4$ is faster for $50\le n \le 100$.
For bigger input sizes the $RLS-N_2$ is clearly the best option.
