For $pmut$ the results are mostly the same as for the (1+1) EA.
The performance is about 250 times worse than for the binomial inputs, but the ranking is still pretty close.
Here the optimal parameter is around $\beta=-1.75$ instead of $\beta=-2.25$.
For $pmut$ the step limit was too small as well, but the difference to the optimal solution was only one on average.
