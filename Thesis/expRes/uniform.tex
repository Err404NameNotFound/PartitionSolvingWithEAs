\section{Uniform distributed inputs}
For the uniform distribution the default values were 1 for the lower bound and 50000 for the upper bound (exclusive).
The range was limited to 50000 to reduce the time the algorithms needs to find an optimal solution.
The higher the values are with too few values the more likely the input is to not have a perfect partition\cite{borgs2001phase}.
This will cause the algorithms to always reach the limit for the number of iterations which drastically increases the time needed for the experiment.
The length of the input was 50000.

\subsection{RLS Comparison}
\input{tables/uniform/rls_compare.tex}
The picture for the RLS variants on this type of input is not clear.
There in no obvious tendency for all variants.
The only obvious thing is the RLS being the worst RLS variant again.
Every variant reaches the optimal solution in every case except for the RLS which only manages for 61 \% of the inputs.
All other variants reach an optimal solution for every input.
The \RLSN[2] seems to be the best variant for these kinds of inputs.
The next best variants are the three \RLSR[s] variants which differ only slightly between each other.

\subsection{(1+1) EA Comparison}
\input{tables/uniform/ea_compare.tex}
The (1+1) EA seems to perform better with a lower mutation rate.
$p_m=4/n$ reaches an optimal solution the fastest but there is no statistically significant difference between $4/n$ and $3/n$ and also not between $3/n$ and $2/n$.
To both sides the average speed of convergence decreases with decreasing/increasing mutation rate.
For the uniform distributed input all variants of the (1+1) EA reach an optimal solution within the step limit except for $100/n$ which does not find an optimal solution in about 0.1 \% of the inputs.
\subsection{pmut Comparison}
\input{tables/uniform/pmut_compare.tex}
The optimal value for $\beta$ seems to be somewhere around 2.0 to 2.25 as there is no statistically significant difference between those two.
The neighbouring values in both directions need more time the greater the difference to 2.0
A major increase of the runtime happens at $\beta=1.5$ and even worse at $\beta=1.25$, yet even the worst parameter manages to find an optimal solution in every run.

\subsection{Comparison of the best variants}
For the uniform distributed input the best variant of the RLS once again seems to perform the best.
But by looking at the smaller values this does not hold in general.

\input{tables/uniform/multipleN_fails.tex}

The RLS variants are the most likely to get stuck in a local optimum for $n\le100$.
The (1+1) EA variants also often do not find an optimal solution, but this happens less frequently.
The more values the input has the more likely it is for any of the algorithms to find a perfect partition.
Between $n=100$ and $n=500$ the performance of the \RLSN[2] drastically increases and for $n\ge500$ this variant of the RLS stays the best variant for the remaining input sizes.
Uniform distributed inputs seem to be much less likely to have a perfect partition for the small input sizes which can be explained by the coefficient of Borgs \etal~\cite{borgs2001phase}.

\input{tables/uniform/multipleN_avg.tex}

The amount of steps needed to find an optimal solution seems to be nearly constant for every algorithm as the number of steps does not strictly increase with $n$ but sometimes even decreases for $n\le1000$.
This is caused by the number of steps the algorithm was given.
For $n\le1000$ the time limit was 100,000 and for the bigger values it was $10n\ln(n)$.
Interestingly enough the average runtime decreases from $n=10000$ to $n=50000$ for most algorithms despite the bigger input size.

\input{tables/uniform/multipleN_totalAvg.tex}

My general advice would be choosing the \RLSN[2] for $n\ge500$ and the (1+1) EA with $p_m=4/n$ otherwise.
