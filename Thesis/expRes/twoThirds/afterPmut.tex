For $pmut$ the result is the exact same as for the (1+1) EA.
The higher (lower absolute value) $\beta$ the better the performance as more bits are flipped in each step.
The algorithm is tricked into the local optima only for $\beta\le-2.5$.
If the algorithm is on the path to the local optimum it is always fast enough to reach it within the time limit.
