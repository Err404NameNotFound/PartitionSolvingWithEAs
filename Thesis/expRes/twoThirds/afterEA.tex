For the EA the result is also the inversion of the results for the OneMax equivalent.
The higher the mutation rate the better at least up to $n\le100$.
From mutation rate $p_m\le3/n$ the algorithm reaches the worst case at least once in 1000 runs.
If the algorithm did not manage to find an optimal solution the fitness was always the same.
So there was no run where any algorithm neither found a global nor the local optimum.
