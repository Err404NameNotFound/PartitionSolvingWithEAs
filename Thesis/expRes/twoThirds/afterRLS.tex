The RLS is by far most likely to get stuck in the local optimum.
The general tendency is the more bits the algorithm flips in expectation the more unlikely the local optimum becomes.
The only case where this does not hold is the $RLS-N_2$ being better than the $RLS-R_4$, although the $RLS-R_4$ flips more bits in expectation.
This might be caused by the higher probability for flipping only one bit for the $RLS-R_4$.
This causes the algorithm to find the local optimum faster before separating $w_1$ and $w_2$.
So the ranking of the algorithms is completely inverted compared to the OneMax input.
The $RLS-N_2$ and $RLS-N_3$ both had runs where they neither found the global nor one of the two local optima.
The algorithms were most likely tricked into the direction of the local optimum and did not manage to leave it.
But they were also not fast enough to reach the local optimum because of their low probability to flip only one bit.
