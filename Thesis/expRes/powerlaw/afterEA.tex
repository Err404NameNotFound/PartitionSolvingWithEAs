Here the same rule holds for the RLS to some extent.
Until $p_m\le50/n$ the speed of convergence increases but at $p_m=100/n$ the speed decreases again.
The optimal value seems to be somewhere between around $p_m=50/n$.
The (1+1) variants are generally faster than all RLS variants when comparing the maximum number of iterations.
For mutation rates $3/n\le p_m \le 100/n$ the (1+1) EA is also faster on average.
The next table shows the results for a powerlaw distribution with $\beta=-1.25$.

With this setting the optimal value is shifted to somewhere around $p_m=4/n$.
The higher mutation rates perform drastically slower with $p_m=100/n$ being 500 times slower than the optimal value.
The speed of convergence is even to slow find an optimal solution for every input in time $10*n\ln(n)$.
