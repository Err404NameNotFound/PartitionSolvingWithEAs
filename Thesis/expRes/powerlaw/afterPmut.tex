For pmut the same holds as for the RLS.
The more bits the algorithms flips on average the better the performance on average.
Surprisingly the performance in the worst runs behaves inverted.
The fewer bits the algorithm flips on average the more stable the search becomes.
This might be caused by the really large amount of bits flipped for the lower values.

The optimal value here seems to be somewhere around $\beta=-1.5$, so only lightly smaller in comparison to the (1+1) EA where the optimal value almost change from one side of the spectrum to the other.
Here the inverted stability of the search does not occur.
The variants that take longer on average tend to also take longer in their worst runs.
