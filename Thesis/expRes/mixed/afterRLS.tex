The results are mostly the same as for the geometric input.
The performance increases with the probability of flipping only one bit.
The main difference is the RLS being the best variant in this case as it reaches an optimal solution in every run.
The penalty of flipping only one bit is greater than for the geometric input but certainly not as drastic as for the OneMax equivalent.
By comparing the average number of iterations it seems like this input is much easier than the geometric input.
