$pmut_\beta$ also performs similar to the geometric input.
Here $\beta=-3.25$ and $\beta=-3.0$ are switched instead of $\beta = -2.5$ and $-3.75$.
Apart from that the algorithm perform strictly ranked by their probability to flip only one bit per step.
Solving the mixed input is easier for the $pmut$ operator too.
All variants manage to find an optimal solution within 1000 steps on average compared to 6,200 steps for the geometric input.
The maximum number of steps is also lower by a factor of at least 10 for every value of $\beta$.
