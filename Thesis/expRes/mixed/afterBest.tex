This input seems generally easy to solve as for every base algorithm are multiple variants which reach an optimal solution within 1000 steps.
The $pmut_-1.75$ variants reaches an optimal solution the fastest, but the other algorithms are almost equally fast.
All algorithms finish within $550 \pm 100$ steps on average and always in less than 2000 steps.

This input is only hard to solve for $n<100$.
For $n = 100$ there are only a few inputs that were not solved within the time limit and for $n\ge500$ the input is solved by each of the chosen algorithms.
This is probably caused by the many small values from the powerlaw and geometric distribution.
