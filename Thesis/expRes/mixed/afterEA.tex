For the (1+1) EA the same holds.
It performs better with decreasing mutation rate with $p_m=2/n$ being the only exception again.
The same was true for the geometric input.
The penality for the wrong parameter is also bigger for the (1+1) EA compared to the geometric input.
So the results are rather similar to the RLS.
