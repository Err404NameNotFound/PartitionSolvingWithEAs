This input does not follow a specific distribution but rather is a mix of the previous distributions.
The value is either chosen uniform random from  or from a binomial distribution \textasciitilde$B(10000, 0.1)$, from a geometric distribution with $p=0.001$ or a powerlaw distribution with $n=-2.75$.
All of the distributions are chosen uniform random.
The process is repeated $n$ times.
The values of this distribution then follow neither of the used distributions.
