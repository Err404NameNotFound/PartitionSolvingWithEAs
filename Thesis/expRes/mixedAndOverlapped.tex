\section{Multiple distributions mixed \& overlapped}
This distribution is again similar to the mixed distribution.
With probability 1/2 the value is chosen from the overlapped distribution and with remaining probability 1/2 the value is chosen from the mixed distribution.

\begin{figure}[h]
      \caption{Distribution of a mixed and overlapped input with \textasciitilde$U(1,999)$, \textasciitilde$B(1000,0.1)$, \textasciitilde$Geo(0.01)$, \textasciitilde$D^{1.25}_{1000}$}
      \centering

\end{figure}

The used distributions were \textasciitilde$U(1,49999)$, \textasciitilde$B(10000,0.1)$, \textasciitilde$Geo(0.001)$, \textasciitilde$D^{1.25}_{50000}$.
By looking at Figure~\ref{fig:mixAndOverlDistExample} it looks like the mixed and overlapped distribution is closer to the mixed distribution than to the overlapped distribution.
The results should also be closer to the mixed distribution.
\subsection{RLS Comparison}


\input{tables/mixedAndOverlapped/rls_compare.tex}

As expected the results are similar to the mixed input.
There is a clear preference of algorithms with higher probability to flip only one bit per step.
Mixed and geometric distributions did not lead to very bad performance for the \RLSN[4].
The mixed and overlapped input punishes the worse mutation operators more than the other two inputs.
In that sense this type of input is closer to the OneMax equivalent, but still way less extreme.
Here still every variant reaches an optimal solution in every case.
\subsection{(1+1) EA Comparison}


\input{tables/mixedAndOverlapped/ea_compare.tex}

The results here are pretty similar to the results of the RLS.
The lower mutation rates perform better and higher mutation rates start to perform worse in comparison to the mixed input.
\subsection{pmut Comparison}


\input{tables/mixedAndOverlapped/pmut_compare.tex}

Here the same holds.
The higher mutation rates are less impacted than the higher rates for the RLS and the (1+1) EA.
\subsection{Comparison of the best variants}


\input{tables/mixedAndOverlapped/best.tex}

The ranking of the algorithm is the same as for the other inputs with a similar preference of low mutation rates.
The RLS has the best performance closely follow by $pmut_{3.25}$ and lastly be the standard (1+1) EA.

\input{tables/mixedAndOverlapped/multipleN_fails.tex}

No unexpected results for the different input sizes.
The RLS variants perform the worst for $n\le 100$.
The input is also rather hard to solve for $n\le50$ but not as hard as the overlapped distributed input for example.

\input{tables/mixedAndOverlapped/multipleN_avg.tex}

The input gets easier to solve up until $n=5000$ and from then on gets harder again with increasing input size.
The increase for larger input sizes is much smaller than the decrease for the small values.

\input{tables/mixedAndOverlapped/multipleN_totalAvg.tex}

Mixed and overlapped inputs are best solved by the (1+1) EA with $p_m=2/n$ for $n\le100$ and also relatively good for $n=500$.
After $n\ge1000$ the standard RLS becomes the best option and it seems like it stays that way for the remaining input sizes.
