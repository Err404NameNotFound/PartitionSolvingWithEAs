For these inputs the variants of the RLS perform differently to the binomial input.
The only similarity is the RLS being the worst as the RLS is the only algorithm that did not find an optimal solution for every input.
If the RLS did find an optimal solution in those 5 cases it would instead be the best RLS variant.
The other algorithms are ranked by the probability of flipping only one bit.
This means at first the three RLS-R variants from 2 to 3 to 4 and then the same for the RLS-N variants.
So it does seem like moving mostly one element at once is better for the geometric input in comparison to two elements for the binomial distribution.
In the 5 cases where the RLS did not find an optimal solution it was most likely stuck in a local optimum.
