The results for the (1+1) EA are similar to the results of the RLS. From mutation rate $3/n$ on the performance decreases with rising mutation rate.
The only part that does not fit into the theory of 1 bit flips being superior is the mutation rate $2/n$ performing better than the standard $1/n$.
The average number of iterations for the standard (1+1) EA is only slightly higher than for the mutation rate $2/n$, so this might be just due to a too small number of runs of the algorithms.
All variants reach an optimal solution within the given limit for the number of iterations.
