The results for the $pmut_\beta$ operator are even more clear than for the (1+1) EA.
With increasing values (decreasing absolute values) for $\beta$ the amounts of flipped bits per step increases.
The performance on the other hand decreases with rising values for $\beta$ which fits into the theory of one bit flips being better for gemoetric distributed inputs.
The only special case that does not support this theory is the value $\beta=-2.5$ performing better than $\beta=-2.75$.
Here the same might hold as for the (1+1) EA.
The number of repetitions of the algorithm might simply be too small to make the small difference in the performance between the two values visible.
The difference in the performance for the $pmut_\beta$ operator is not as drastic as for the (1+1) EA.
Only $\beta=-1.25$ performs significantly worse the next best value.
