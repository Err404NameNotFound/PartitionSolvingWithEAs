This kind of input is more or less equivalent to the OneMax problem. All values except the last are either 1 or follow any distribution. The last value is the sum of all other values. The optimal solution is therefore the 000\dots01 or
the 111\dots01 string. So the best solution is almost identical to OneMax/ZeroMax depending on the value of the last bit.\newline
For OneMax the mutation rate of 1/n is proven to be optimal for the (1+1) EA~\cite{witt2013tight}.
This should also hold for this input.
The RLS variants should also perform worse than the standard RLS.
The higher the value for $\beta$ the better the $pmut_\beta$ mutation should perform.
With some testing with various algorithm variants it looked like the last bit was only flipped at most once for every input.
There was only one case where it was flipped twice, but it was never flipped more than twice per run.\newline
For some experiments not all 1000 repetitions were executed as there was a clear tendency which of the algorithms performs better.
