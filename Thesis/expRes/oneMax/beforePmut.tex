The results for the $pmut$ operator are pretty similar to the results for the (1+1) EA and the RLS.
The parameter $\beta=-3.25$ which flips the least bits on average finds the solution the fastest.
The other values for $\beta$ increase the time needed for finding one of the two optimums with increasing value for $\beta$ (decreasing in the absolute value).
All variants find an optimum in every run except for $\beta=-1.25$ which has a much higher value for the number of flipped bits per steps.
The average number for the number of bits flipped in a successful mutation is much lower than for the other inputs especially for the higher (absolute lower) values for $\beta$.
For the binomial and geometric input the successful average was around 100 for $\beta=-1.25$ but for the OneMax equivalent it was only at 5.
