The results for this experiment are as expected.
All three algorithms find the optimal value within the time limit.
The RLS performs better than the (1+1) EA because it does only single bit flips.
The $pmut_{-3.25}$ perform better than the standard (1+1) EA although flipping more bits on average.
This is most likely cause by the few steps where $pmut$ flips many bits which increase the average.
But $pmut$ most likely chooses to flip only one bit more often as the (1+1) EA.

TODO insert comparison with multiple values of n.
