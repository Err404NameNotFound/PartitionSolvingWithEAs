The picture for the RLS variants on this type of input is not clear.
There in no obvious tendency for neither of the variants.
The only obvious thing is the RLS being the worst of the RLS variants again.
Every variant reaches the optimal solution in every case except for the RLS which only manages for roughly 50 \% of the inputs.
The RLS-N(2) seems to be the best variant for these kinds of inputs.
The next best variants are the RLS-(R) with $k=3$ and $k=4$ which only differ by 1 \%.
