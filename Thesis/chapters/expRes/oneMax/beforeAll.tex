This kind of input is more or less equivalent to the OneMax problem. All values except the last are either 1 or uniform
random in any interval. The last value is the sum of all other values. The optimal solution is therefore the 000\dots01 or
the 111\dots01 string. So the best solution is almost identical to OneMax. In the previous chapter the $\mathcal{O}(nlogn)$ bound was
proven for the (1+1) EA and the RLS. This seems to hold in practice:
TODO: insert Graph showing RLS and (1+1) EA need time O(nlogn)

For OneMax the mutation rate of 1/n is proven to be optimal for the (1+1) EA (TODO insert cite). This seems to be also
true for the equivalent for PARTITION. For Both the (1+1) EA and both new Variants of the RLS
