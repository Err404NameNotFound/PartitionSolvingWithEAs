For the (1+1) EA the best static mutation rate seems to be $3/n$. 
The probability of flipping 2 or 4 bits as n goes to infinity for mutation rate $1/n$ approaches $13/24e\approx 0.199$, for $2/n$ approaches $8/3e^2\approx 0.361$, for $3/n$ approaches $63/8e^3\approx 0.392$, for $4/n$ approaches $56/3e^4\approx 0.342$ and for $5/n$ approaches $77/2e^5\approx 0.259$. So the highest probability has $c=3$, followed by $c=4$ and $c=2$ then $c=5$ and lastly $c=1$. For higher values of $c$ the probability decreases further as the expected number of flipped bits is $c$ for mutation rate $c/n$.
