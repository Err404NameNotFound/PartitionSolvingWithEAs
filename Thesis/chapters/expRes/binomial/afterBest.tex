For this setting of $m=10000, p=0.1, n=10000$ the RLS-N with $k=2$ performs better than the  (1+1) EA and $pmut_\beta$ mutation for all values of $c/n$ and $\beta$ by a factor of at least 2. This is likely from the fact that this version of the RLS flips almost only two bits which seems to be close to optimal for this kind of input as there are many values close to the expected value which can be switched to make small adjustments to the fitness value. The (1+1) EA with $p=3/n$ and $pmut_\beta$ algorithm with $\beta=-2.25$ perform almost the same. The (1+1) EA has a slightly lower average value but also has a higher minimum value and a higher maximum value.
