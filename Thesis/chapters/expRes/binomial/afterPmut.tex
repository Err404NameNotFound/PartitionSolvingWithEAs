For the $pmut_\beta$ mutation operator the choice of $\beta$ seems to be much more insignificant than for the RLS or (1+1) EA. Here all values perform comparably good with only the value of $\beta = -1.25$ having a clear performance difference compared to next best value. All values of $\beta$ reach an optimal solution in every case. The worst variant of the $pmut_\beta$ operator still performs much better than the worst value for the (1+1) EA and even better than the worst RLS variant.
